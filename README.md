## Abstract:

With the advent of digital media readers are overwhelmed with the volume of news and information available on the internet. An individual is left to navigate the numerous news websites and articles alone, and often finds himself lost in the massive amount of information. Our news aggregator web app, FeedMe, aims to simplify the news reading experience for people by acting as a one-stop-shop for the latest news from a variety of publishers, categories and  geographies. Moreover, FeedMe will allow the user to add and modify their subscriptions on the basis of categories, locations etc. Thus, we don’t just simplify, we empower the reader.


## How is this problem currently solved?

Several apps and websites such as Google Current, RSS feeds, Flipboard, Pulse etc. have attempted to aggregate the news for the reader. However, most of them have either been discontinued or do not provide sufficient user interaction, resulting in readers resorting to social media websites such as Twitter to get their news, which allows the user a high degree of interaction.

## How will this project make life easier?

Unlike existing news feeds, FeedMe will not only provide a platform for users to read trending news, but also allow them to engage with it and express their opinions. It will provide the perfect intersection between news-reading and social engagement.
In just one simple step, users will be able to create an account on FeedMe and customize their subscriptions by determining which publishers, categories,  and geographic locations they wish to receive news from. Moreover, once users have an account they will be able to share their favorite news articles on social media, write blogs to express their perspectives and receive notifications.

By combing news-reading with the ability to engage with the content, FeedMe will immensely simplify the user’s experience.

## Who is the target audience? Who will use your product?

While traditional news feed sites target avid news readers, our web app simplifies news-reading so that everyone who wishes to read news can do so in a few simple steps, especially those who have traditionally felt overwhelmed by the volume of articles available online.

## What is the scope of your project? Does this project have many individual features, or one main feature (possibility with many subproblems)? These are the ‘epics’ of your project.

Currently, the goal is to centralize news feeds for the users / subscribers.  With further iterations we plan to incorporate additional features such as news sharing, chatting, blogging, notifications, favorite section and so on. These are the epics / individual features and they will be added to our project with each iteration. We expect our application to scale nicely with the number of features and news channel subscriptions that it can support.

## What are some sample stories/scenarios? For example, as  a regular user to your site, what types of things can I do? As an admin for your site? These are the ‘stories’ of your project.

As a computer science student who is very passionate about block-chain technology, I would like to keep myself updated about new developments in the field. I can imagine using this application to have access to the aggregated information.

As a CMPT276 student I rarely have time to scroll and look for new articles that meet my specific needs, therefore with FeedMe I would be able to quickly search for specific articles with specific keywords

As a cricket fan I would use FeedMe to search for relevant articles about specific cricket matches, scorecard updates, analysis reports and highlights.

As an individual running an ecommerce business in men’s style, I would utilize FeedMe’s aggregate feature to facilitate my research on the current and latest style trends in the market and save me a considerable amount of time.

As an avid blogger, FeedMe would allow me to openly discuss news articles that are of interest to me with other readers who may share the same interests.
