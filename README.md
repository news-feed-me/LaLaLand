## Abstract:

With the advent of digital media, readers are overwhelmed with the volume of news and information flooded on the internet. An individual is left with the numerous news websites and articles, and often finds themselves lost in the massive amount of information. Our news aggregator web app, FeedMe, aims to simplify the news reading experience for people by acting as a one-stop-shop for the latest news from a variety of publishers, categories and  geographies. Moreover, FeedMe will allow the user to add and modify their subscriptions on the basis of categories, locations etc. Thus, we don’t just simplify, we empower the reader.


## How is this problem currently solved?

Several apps and websites such as Google Current, RSS feeds, Flipboard, Pulse etc. have attempted to aggregate the news for the reader. However, most of them have either been discontinued or do not provide sufficient user interaction, resulting in readers resorting to social media websites such as Twitter to get their news, which allows the user a high degree of interaction.

## How will this project make life easier?

Unlike existing news feeds, FeedMe will also provide user interaction with the news feed by allowing them to express their views. It will provide the perfect intersection between news-reading and social engagement.

In just one simple step, users will be able to create an account on FeedMe and customize their subscriptions by determining which publishers, categories, and geographic locations they wish to receive news from. Moreover, once users have an account they will be able to share their favorite news articles on social media, write blogs to express their perspectives and receive notifications.

FeedMe will immensely simplify the user’s experience by combining news-raeding with the ability to engage with the content.

## Who is the target audience? Who will use your product?

While traditional news feed sites target avid news readers, our web app simplifies news-reading so that everyone who wishes to read news can do so in a few simple steps, especially those who have traditionally felt overwhelmed by the volume of articles available online.

## What is the scope of your project? Does this project have many individual features, or one main feature (possibility with many subproblems)? These are the ‘epics’ of your project.

Currently, the goal is to centralize news feeds for the users / subscribers.  With further iterations we plan to incorporate additional features such as news sharing, chatting, blogging, notifications, favorite section and so on. These are the epics / individual features and they will be added to our project with each iteration. We expect our application to scale nicely with the number of features and news channel subscriptions that it can support.

## User Stories as different users

As a CMPT276 student I rarely have time to scroll for new articles that meet my specific needs, with FeedMe I would be able to quickly search for specific articles with my personalized keywords.
